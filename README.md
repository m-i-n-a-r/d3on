# D3on
D3on is a simple collection of **ideas** and components developed using the **D3 js** library. They can be used to **improve the design** of a webpage or to give a **fancier look** to a particular component.

### Status: V 0.2

## Contents
- **fancy-s3t**: a customizable set of moving and interactive nodes, to display a list of skills, products and so on! The list is taken from a json file. To test this locally, run a simple http server on your machine. If you have python3 installed, you can do that opening a cmd or terminal in your project folder and typing `python -m http.server`.
- **rad3ar**: a radar-style (also called star plot) interactive and customizable visualization. The data-points are taken from a json file. To test this locally, run a simple http server on your machine. If you have python3 installed, you can do that opening a cmd or terminal in your project folder and typing `python -m http.server`.
- **sparky-icon**: just select the id of an icon in your page and select the effects to apply, to obtain a vivid and animated icon. Just make sure to select an icon or an image! **[WIP]**
- More to come..

## Usage
Just download or clone the project, and **copy** the desired component in your webpage. Make sure to customize it and connect it with the right elements. You can easily embed the js part in the html page using the script tag. For easier understanding, every different part of a single component was splitted in **css**, **html** and **js** files, plus a **json** containing data, if needed. **D3 v5**, **D3 v4** and **D3 v3** were used.
