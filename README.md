# D3on
D3on is a simple collection of **ideas** and components developed using the **D3 js** library. They can be used to **improve the design** of a webpage or to give a **fancier look** to a particular component.

### Status: V 0.1

## Contents
- **fancy-s3t**: a customizable set of moving and interactive canvas, to display a list of skills, products and so on!
- More to come..

## Usage
Just download or clone the project, and **copy** the desired component in your webpage. Make sure to customize it and connect it with the right elements. You can easily embed the js part in the html page using the script tag. For easier understanding, every different part of a single component was splitted in **css**, **html** and **js** files, plus a **json** containing data, if needed. Both **D3 v5** and **D3 v3** were used.
